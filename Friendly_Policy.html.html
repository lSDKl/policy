This Privacy Policy outlines the privacy practices associated with the Friendly App Service and covers our treatment of personal information that we collect when you install a mobile application that uses our Service. Please note that we are not responsible for and have no control of any mobile application’s (including the Affiliated Application’s) privacy practices and have no control over how the developer of a mobile application collects, uses or shares information about you. For information about how a mobile application collects, uses or shares information about you, please see the applicable mobile application’s privacy policy.

When you install an Affiliated Application on your device that uses our Service, we may automatically collect certain information from your Android device, device make and model, mobile web browser type and version, IP address, MAC address, the device’s operating system’s make and version, locale information, MCC (Mobile Country Code) information, the mobile application name, a list of mobile applications installed on your device and other technical data about your device.
When you install an Affiliated Application, you may also grant the mobile application permission to collect certain types of information via a permission screen consent process and to use some of your network connection and device’s resources when your resources are idle and use WiFi (only occasionally cellular data may be used, but very limited).
We do not control the permission screen consent process – it is typically run by your mobile operating system; HOWEVER, ONCE SUCH PERMISSION IS GRANTED BY YOU ON AN OPT-IN BASIS, WE MAY COLLECT SOME, BUT NOT ALL, OF THE INFORMATION THAT A MOBILE APPLICATION COLLECTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PERMISSIONS YOU GRANT. FOR EXAMPLE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH YOUR PERMISSION TO THE AFFILIATED APPLICATION, WE MAY COLLECT PRECISE GEOLOCATION, BROWSER HISTORY, COUNTRY, ZIP CODE AND DEVICE IDS (INCLUDING IMEI, DEVICE SERIAL NUMBER AND MAC ADDRESS) AND/OR ANY OTHER PERSONAL OR IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (THE “PERSONAL INFORMATION”). We or our data partners may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Service. For example, we may collect one of the unique identifiers associated with your mobile device as listed above and demographic or interest preference information from other companies and combine that with information we collect through the Service to allow our customers to deliver advertisements that may be of interest to you on your mobile device or to identify you on other devices or browsers. We anonymize all Personal Information on your device before collecting it or sharing it with our data partners.
                Affiliated Application incorporates third party oneAudience services for gathering information from your device with oneAudience’s privacy policy located here - http://www.oneaudience.com/privacy/.

                In addition to other information described in this policy, we may collect and share precise location information, through methods such as mobile “SDKs”.  This location information may be used by itself, aggregated, or combined with mobile identifiers (such as IDFAs and Android IDs), and shared with third parties, for purposes related to advertising, attribution (e.g., measuring ad performance) analytics
and research.   You can remove your consent to having your location data collected by changing the settings on your device.(Certain services may lose functionality as a result.)
You can opt-out from any interest-based advertising through your device settings. When you have opted out using this setting on a device, advertisers will not use in-app information collected from that device to infer your interests or serve ads to that device that are targeted based on your inferred interests

The security of your information is important to us.
