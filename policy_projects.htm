<!-- <li>You may request access to, correction of, or erasure of your personal information by going to <a href="https://PubgHackspeak.com/dashboard">https://PubgHackspeak.com/dashboard</a>.</li> -->
<li>You may request that we restrict processing of your personal 
information or object to our processing of your personal information by 
contacting our Data Protection Officer, in which case you will no longer
 be able to have an account with PubgHack.</li>
<!-- <li>You may request that (a) we provide you with your personal information in a structure, commonly used and machine-readable format, and (b) we transmit your personal information to a third party, by going to <a href="https://PubgHackspeak.com/dashboard">https://PubgHackspeak.com/dashboard</a>.  This is referred to as “Data Portability.”  </li> -->
<li>You may withdraw your consent at any time by deleting your account with us.</li>
<!-- <li>If you reside in the EEA, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority of your member state.  For a list of supervisory authorities, please see <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm</a></li> -->
<li>You are not obligated to provide any personal information, but (a) 
if you do not provide your email address, we will not be able to 
communicate with you, and (b) if you do not provide us with voice

affect how our Service works for you.    </li>
</ul>
<h2>ADVERTISING AND REMARKETING</h2>
<p>We may allow other companies, called third party ad servers or ad 
networks, to serve advertisements within the Site or the App. These 
third party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly 
to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Site. 
They automatically receive your IP Address when this happens. They may 
also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web 
beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to 
personalize their advertising content. Further, these advertisers may 
also serve ads to you on other websites (including ads for our products 
and services) based on information collected from you while using the 
Site.  For example, we may use Google’s “remarketing” service to target 
our ads to you based on your prior use of the Site or the App when you 
visit on other sites in Google’s content network.</p>
<p>You should be aware that advertisers may target advertisements to 
users based on certain user characteristics.  If you respond to this 
type of targeted advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude
 that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.
Our Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the 
activities of, such ad servers, ad networks, or their advertiser 
clients.</p>
<h2>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</h2>
<p>The Site may contain links or references to external websites. These 
are provided for your convenience only, and we do not have control over 
the privacy or security practices and policies of third party sites. Any
 personal information you provide on linked pages is provided directly 
to that third party and is subject to that third party's privacy policy.
 Please learn about the privacy and security practices and policies of 
external websites before providing them with personal information.</p>
<h2>CHILDREN</h2>
<p>Consistent with the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act 
of 1998 (COPPA), we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable 
information from anyone under the age of thirteen (13) without parental 
consent. Any person who provides their personal information to us 
through the Site represents that they are 13 years of age or older.  We 
ask for and store users’ date of birth to ensure they are 13 or older, 
but do not share that information unless the user chooses to share it on
 the user’s profile.  If you believe that we have collected information 
from an individual under the age of 13, please contact us so that we may
 take appropriate steps to address the issue.</p>
<h2>SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>We take steps to help protect personal information. No company can 
fully prevent security risks, however.  Mistakes may happen. Bad actors 
may defeat even the best safeguards.</p>
<h2>TRANSFER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER COUNTRIES</h2>
<p>Your personal information will be transferred to, and stored and 
processed in, the United States, and may in the future be transferred 
to, and stored and processed in, other countries.  All transfers will 
either (a) be under the European Commission’s model contracts for the 
transfer of personal information to third countries, or (b) rely on the 
EU-US Privacy Shield framework.</p>
<h2>CONTACT INFORMATION / DATA PROTECTION OFFICER</h2>
<p>If you have questions, comments or complaints about this Privacy 
Policy or our privacy practices, or would like to exercise any of your 
rights and choices under this Privacy Policy or applicable law, you may 
contact our Data Protection Officer at the following email address:
codenameone2007@gmail.com</p>
<h2>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will 
also revise the "updated date" on the Privacy Policy. For changes to 
this Privacy Policy that may be materially less restrictive on our use 
or disclosure of personal information that you have provided to us, the 
new policy will not apply to information collected prior to the change 
unless we obtain your consent. We encourage you to periodically review 
this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the 
personal information we collect. Your continued use of the Service 
constitutes your going forward agreement to this Privacy Policy and any 
updates.</p>
